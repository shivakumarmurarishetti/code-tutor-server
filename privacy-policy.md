Privacy Policy for Code Tutor

Code Tutor is designed to help users understand and improve code directly on webpages. 
Your privacy is important to us.

1. Data Collection
Code Tutor does NOT collect personal information, browsing history, passwords, or account data.

The extension only processes text that the user explicitly selects or interacts with on a webpage.

2. How Data Is Used
Selected code snippets may be sent securely to a remote AI service to generate explanations, improvements, or timelines. 
This data is used only to produce the requested response and is not stored or sold.

3. Storage
The extension may use local browser storage to save interface preferences such as panel position or UI settings. 
No personal data is stored.

4. Third-Party Services
Code Tutor uses external AI APIs to generate responses. These services process only the text provided by the user.

5. Security
We do not track users, inject advertisements, or collect sensitive information.

6. Changes
This policy may be updated if new features are added. Continued use of the extension implies acceptance of updates.
